GDLC COMPILER PROCESS
=====================================

This document decribes how the Guideline Compiler (GDLC) works.


Overview
--------

There are three basic steps to the process:

	1. 	Parse the input file and turn the GDL code into an 
		Abstract Symbol Tree (AST).
		
	2. 	Walk the AST and compile it into objects (variables, rules, rulesets, 
		lookups, guideline, etc)
		
	3.	Walk the compiled guideline and output the objects as XML.

Much of the heavy lifting is done through the use of 'plugins'. Plugins are
used to help with modularity and code re-use.
