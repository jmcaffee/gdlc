GDLC BUILD PROCESS
=====================================

This document decribes the build process for creating the 
Guideline Compiler (GDLC).


Overview
--------

Generate JavaCC grammar file (.jj) and Java source files based on 
the JJTree grammar file (.jjt).
	Grammar source files are generated in #{basedir}/grammar/build

Using JavaCC, generate Token Manager files (in #{basedir}/grammar/build)

Backup the old (generated) files located in the application source tree.
	Backed up to #{basedir}/backup/src/runtime/parser
	
Copy all generated parser files into the application's source tree.
	#{basedir}/src/runtime/parser

Replace generated files with customized versions of the files.
	Delete files to be customized.
	Copy custom versions to application source tree.
	Custom files are located at #{basedir}/grammar/src and are copied
	to #{basedir}/src/runtime/parser

Build the application.


Generating JavaCC grammar file
------------------------------

JJTree is used to generate the JavaCC grammar file.
JJTree options are set within the .jjt file so there is no need to set any
options other than the output directory.
