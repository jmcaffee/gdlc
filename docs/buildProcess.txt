GDLC BUILD PROCESS
=====================================

This document decribes the build process for creating the 
Guideline Compiler (GDLC).


Overview
--------

Generate JavaCC grammar file (.jj) and Java source files based on 
the JJTree grammar file (.jjt).

Using JavaCC, generate Token Manager files.

Backup generated files because we are going to delete some of them; these 
files will be replaced with customized versions.

Delete files to be customized.

Copy all generated parser files into the application's source tree.

Build the application.


Generating JavaCC grammar file
------------------------------

JJTree is used to generate the JavaCC grammar file.
JJTree options are set within the .jjt file so there is no need to set any
options other than the output directory.
